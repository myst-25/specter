# Specter Changelog

## v1.3.0

### VBMeta / Boot Hash — Complete Overhaul

- **Removed `read_vbmeta()`** (`common.sh`) — was computing SHA-256 of the raw vbmeta partition. The VBMeta Digest is a different value (digest over parsed VBMeta structs, set by the bootloader). Raw partition hashing is incorrect and produced wrong results on every device.
- **Removed inline vbmeta fixer** (`service.sh`) — the early-boot block-device read that set `ro.boot.vbmeta.size` / `hash_alg` / `avb_version` / `digest` from raw partition data. Removed entirely.
- **Rewrote `boot_hash.sh`** — new fallback chain: existing system property → `/proc/cmdline` → user config `/sdcard/Specter/boot_hash` → stored file `/data/adb/boot_hash` → skip. No block device read, no `sha256sum`/`blockdev` dependency, no zero fallback.
- **Removed zero fallback** — no longer writes `0000...0000` to `ro.boot.vbmeta.digest` or `/data/adb/boot_hash`. If no valid source, the script exits without touching anything.
- **Zero-value guard added** — user config and stored file inputs that are all zeros are now rejected.
- **Boot hash priority reordered** (`boot_hash.sh`): `read_vbmeta()` (block device) now runs before the cached file. Previously, a transient failure on first boot would write zeros to the cache, permanently blocking re-read. Now: user override → block device → cached fallback.
- **`service.sh` guard removed**: the `[ ! -f "/data/adb/boot_hash" ]` guard that skipped setting `ro.boot.vbmeta.digest` from the live block device when cache existed was removed.
- **`boot_hash.sh` reads `/proc/cmdline`** — new source: the bootloader's `androidboot.vbmeta.digest=` survives module interference and restores the original value even if previously corrupted.

### download() / Network
- Swapped priority: **wget first, curl fallback** — wget ships with Android (toybox), curl does not. Reduces unnecessary errors and timeouts on devices without curl.
- `check_network()` also updated to try wget first for consistency.

### Keybox Script Fixes
- **Unguarded curl in fallback probe** (`keybox.sh`): added `command -v` guard + `2>/dev/null` to both curl and wget calls.
- **`sort -R` removed** (`keybox.sh`): `sort -R` is a GNU extension, not available on busybox/toybox Android builds. Replaced with POSIX-compatible `awk` random selection.
- **Custom keybox detection** (`app.ts`): added wget-first fallback in the shell command string — same priority pattern as `download()`.

### Play Store Clear Data
- **`kill_play_store.sh`** and **`gms.sh`**: replaced `cmd package trim-caches 999999999 com.android.vending` with `pm clear com.android.vending`. `trim-caches` only accepts a size argument and only clears system cache — never app data. `pm clear` actually deletes private data, forcing Play Store re-registration after a keybox swap.

### Installer (customize.sh)
- **Timeout on all vol-key prompts**: each prompt defaults after 8 seconds of no input — skip keybox install, skip target.txt generation, default to Specter priority for module conflicts. Uses `timeout` (toybox) to poll `getevent` at 1-second intervals.
- **Download timeout guard**: keybox download wrapped in background + kill loop with 30-second hard cap — prevents endless waits if network hangs.
- **Target.txt prompt**: new prompt after keybox installation — asks whether to run `target.sh` immediately.
- **Removed VBMeta-Fixer from conflict prompt** — the module isn't in the conflict registry, so the installer shouldn't offer a choice for it.

### Conflict Registry — New Additions
- **Sensitive Props** (`sensitive_props`): added with features `boot_hardening`, `suspicious_props`, `rom_spoof`. Detected by `/data/adb/modules/sensitive_props/`.
- **Yurikey Manager** (`Yurikey`): added with features `boot_hardening`, `security_patch`, `suspicious_props`, `rom_spoof`. Detected by `/data/adb/modules/Yurikey/`.
- **Integrity Box** (`integritybox`): added with features `boot_hardening`, `security_patch`, `suspicious_props`, `rom_spoof`, `bootloader_spoofer`, `target`. Detected by `/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix/` + `/data/adb/Box-Brain/` marker to distinguish from actual PIF.

### Conflict Resolution
- **`apply_conflict_toggles()` now writes both `toggle_*` AND `toggle_action_*`** — previously only wrote `toggle_*`, so the action pipeline bypassed conflict resolution entirely. Now when a conflicting module claims a feature, both boot-time and pipeline toggles are set to 0.
- **NoHello registry narrowed**: `zygisk_nohello` claims reduced from 7 features to just `boot_hardening` — NoHello only sets boot props; the other 6 phantom claims were incorrect and caused Specter features to go missing when NoHello was prioritized.
- **`refreshControlToggles()`**: added missing `toggle-recovery` entry — the recovery toggle was not synced after a conflict change.
- **Removed VBMeta-Fixer from conflict registry** — no overlapping features.
- **Removed `boot_hash` from TSupport-Advance conflict entry** — Specter's boot hash feature no longer conflicts with any module.
- **Removed `boot_hash` from `apply_conflict_toggles()`** iteration — `toggle_boot_hash` is no longer overridden by conflict resolution.

### Feature Script Self-Guards Removed
- **`boot_hash.sh`** and **`security_patch.sh`**: removed internal `cfg_get toggle_* = "0" && exit 0` guard. These scripts are called from multiple contexts (service, boot-completed, action pipeline) each with their own toggle gate. The self-guard was redundant and wrong — e.g., `toggle_boot_hash=0` would block the action pipeline even when `toggle_action_boot_hash=1`.

### PIF Default Off
- `toggle_action_pif` now defaults to `0` (disabled) — PIF has its own update mechanism and shouldn't run from Specter's pipeline unless the user explicitly enables it.
- WebUI toggle defaults updated accordingly in both `wireControlToggles` and `refreshControlToggles`.

### Action Pipeline Message
- Changed misleading `"Meets Strong Integrity with Specter"` to `"Full integrity pipeline completed"` — the pipeline runs the steps but doesn't verify the actual Play Integrity result.

### Early Boot Conflict Resolution
- **New `post-fs-data.sh`**: runs `resolve_conflicts()` at the earliest boot stage (`post-fs-data`), before other modules' scripts execute. This ensures conflicting modules are renamed to `.bak` before they can set their own boot props.
- **`service.sh`**: removed duplicate `resolve_conflicts()` call — now handled by `post-fs-data.sh`.

### Boot-time Features Gated (boot-completed.sh)
- Added `_feature_enabled` gates for `toggle_boot_hardening`, `toggle_boot_hash`, `toggle_security_patch`, `toggle_suspicious_props`, `toggle_rom_spoof` on KernelSU/APatch — previously ran all features unconditionally, ignoring conflict resolution.

### New Features

- **Binary-level prop deletion** (`common.sh`): new `hexpatch_deleteprop()` function — uses `magickboot hexpatch` to overwrite property values in `/dev/__properties__/` with random hex, making deletion undetectable at the API level. Falls back to `resetprop --delete` if magickboot is unavailable. Used by `suspicious_props.sh` for stealthier cleaning.
- **AVB header-based vbmeta.size** (`boot_hash.sh`): parses the real AVB0 header from the vbmeta block device to compute `256 + auth_data + aux_data` sizes — more accurate than `blockdev --getsize64` which gives raw partition size.
- **`ro.boot.vbmeta.invalidate_on_error=yes`** (`boot_hash.sh`): now set alongside the digest for more complete vbmeta prop coverage.
- **Periodic suspicious props re-cleaning** (`service.sh`): re-runs `suspicious_props.sh` every hour in the background — catches properties that get re-set after boot.
- **File permission hardening** (`service.sh`): `/proc/cmdline` → 440, `/proc/net/unix` → 440, `install-recovery.sh` → 440, `/system/addon.d` → 750. Gated behind `toggle_boot_hardening`.
- **Interactive App Targeting overlay** — full-screen Material 3 sub-page replacing SmartMerge:
  - Searchable app list with filter chips (All / Selected / Not Selected)
  - 4-state cycling circle: unchecked → bare → ? → ! per app
  - Selected items always sort to the top
  - Floating Apply button (`md-fab`) with primary colors
  - Cloud-hosted app label catalog (rawbin) with version-based caching
  - Only user-installed apps shown by default; "Show system apps" toggle in three-dot menu (system apps preserve their target.txt state)
  - **Blacklist mode** — switch to blacklist editing via three-dot menu: header turns error-container, state circles become on/off toggle with block icon, filter chips update, apply writes to `/data/adb/Specter/blacklist.txt`
  - Native M3 page transition — slides in from right on enter (300ms, `emphasized-decelerate`), slides back right on exit (200ms, `emphasized-accelerate`), matching standard Android drill-in navigation
  - Magisk DenyList import
  - Back button with muted `secondary-container` accent
  - Div-based dropdown menu matching TS Addon styling
  - Dev mock with 35+ realistic test apps and DenyList data
- **App Catalog management page** (rawbin) — standalone CRUD interface for maintaining package → app name mappings with sortable table, search, dialogs, bulk JSON import/export, and version-based cache invalidation.
- **Full catalog caching** — version check (`/apps/version`) before downloading full catalog; cache stores all 592 entries so system apps get names too.
- **Blacklist consolidated into App Targeting** — removed standalone Blacklist section from Tools page; accessible via overlay's three-dot menu with the same interactive list UI
- **SmartMerge removed** — replaced entirely by the interactive App Targeting overlay
- **Code cleanup** — removed dead translation keys (`menu_smartmerge*`, `toast_smartmerge_saved`, `menu_blacklist`, `menu_blacklist_toggle*`), removed unused imports in `device.ts`, removed orphaned `wireBlacklistToggle` from `app.ts`
- **PlayStrong label fix** — renamed `io.github.mhmrdd.libxposed.ps.passit` from "PassIt" to "PlayStrong" in both the app catalog and RKA error message
- **Security Patch dialog** — "Set Security Patch" now opens an M3 dialog with a date input field pre-filled with the previous month's 5th; added a trailing `autorenew` icon button to auto-generate the computed date; user can edit before saving
- **Consistent logging** — App Targeting overlay now logs all operations with `[TARGET]` prefix to the terminal, matching the convention of other feature scripts

### Bug Fixes
- **Removed `boot_hash.sh`** — the boot hash (`ro.boot.vbmeta.digest`) is computed automatically by the bootloader/AVB. Overriding it is pointless. Removed the feature script, pipeline entry, all action/service/boot references, control toggles, translation keys, and Tools/Control page entries.
- **Removed `pif2.sh`** — "Fix PIF Detection" was a one-time cleanup of ROM spoof engine persistent props. The boot-time `block_rom_spoof_engines` already handles this after every reboot. Any module that requires a restart makes the on-demand button redundant. Removed the feature script, wrapper, Tools page entry, and translation keys.
- **Custom keybox URL: raw file no longer copied on decode failure** (`keybox.sh`) — if the downloaded custom keybox isn't valid base64, the script now restores the backup and exits with an error instead of writing garbage to `keybox.xml`.
- **`set -e` safety** (`cleanup.sh`, `common.sh`): added `2>/dev/null || true` guards to `resetprop` calls in `cleanup.sh:105-106` and `disable_rom_spoof_engines():370`. Added `|| true` to `apply_boot_hardening` call in `cleanup.sh:110`. Prevents mid-script abort if these commands fail.
- **Removed dead code** (`common.sh`): `resolve_module_root()` — never called, logic already inlined in `device-info.sh`.
- **Persisted props not restored on uninstall** (`uninstall.sh`) — `sp_persist()` writes `restore|prop|val` format but uninstall checked for `^resetprop -n -p`. Now parses the actual format with `IFS='|'` and emits `resetprop -n -p` for each entry.
- **`apply_prop_hardening()` wiped `ro.build.fingerprint`** (`common.sh`) — `check_prop "ro.build.fingerprint" ""` set the fingerprint to empty string. Removed.
- **Zygisk Next version comparison broken by `v` prefix** (`zygisk_next.sh`) — `version_ge "v1.3.0" "1.3.0"` always returned false because awk casts non-numeric to 0. Added `sed 's/^v//'` to strip the prefix.
- **`apply_prop_hardening()` now consistently returns 0** — prevents `set -e` exits in cleanup.sh.

### i18n / Translations
- **Added 24 missing Control page keys** to all 4 translations (ar, zh, ru, es) — the entire "Boot Behavior", "Action Pipeline", and "Conflict Resolution" sections were previously missing from non-English.
- **Fixed `menu_force_clear_desc`** — updated across all translations to match the new description.
- **Fixed `update_desc`** — was empty in all 4 translations, now translated.
- **Fixed `advance_fix_detect_pif`** — removed spurious `(1)` suffix from Chinese and Russian.
- **Translated previously untranslated keys**: `dialog_cancel`, `tools_danger_zone`, `tools_danger_zone_desc`, `danger_confirm_msg`, `nav_tools`, `nav_control`, `home_security_patch`, 9 `theme_preset_*` color names, 25 tool page descriptions, and 20+ toast/device/history keys.
- **Added 26 new i18n keys**: file browser (empty state, show all), conflict toasts (Module/Specter handles it), priority prefix, toast messages for blacklist/smartmerge/recovery/detection, time labels (Today at / Yesterday at), history buttons (Copy/Copied/Failed), device status labels (TEE Sim, Not Installed, Private Keybox, etc.).
- **Fixed 5 hardcoded English strings** in code: `index.html` (Auto dropdown), `app.ts` (conflict hint + toast), `file-browser.ts` (empty state + show all).
- All 4 translations now at 180 keys — fully synced with source.

### Other
- Updated `docs/CONFLICTS.md` — removed VBMeta-Fixer row, updated NoHello and TSupport descriptions.
- Fixed `README.md` — updated nav reference from Setup to Tools, merged Maintain features into Tools description, added Control page to features list.

## v1.1.0

### GMS & Boot Stability
- Removed multi-package GMS force-stop from boot loop — was logging users out of Google accounts and causing root manager crashes. Replaced with lightweight Play Store-only kill via `kill_play_store.sh`.
- Added `detect_root_solution()` call in `service.sh` and `boot-completed.sh` so `$ROOT_SOL` is properly set before prop operations.
- Replaced inline installer-env root detection in `customize.sh` with `detect_root_solution()`.

### Property System
- Replaced `resetprop_if_diff` / `resetprop_if_match` with streamlined `sp_try()`.
- Renamed `persistprop` → `sp_persist()`.
- Added `disable_bootloader_spoofer()` — scans for 3 packages (bootloader spoofer, HyperCeiler, LuckyTool).

### HMA-OSS
- Uses `$HMA_DIR`/`$HMA_FILE` from centralized `paths.sh`.
- Built-in fallback template with 60 apps using proper HMA-OSS schema.

### Boot Hash
- Guarded `read_vbmeta()` with command availability check — no more exit 127 on devices without sha256sum/blockdev.

### Target Script
- TEESimulator locked.xml section rewritten — uses `sed`+`grep -Fvxf` with temp files (compatible with Android's mksh).
- Props in `service.sh` reorganized into logical groups.

### New Files
- `features/kill_play_store.sh` — Play Store kill moved here, out of boot loop.
- `features/suspicious_props.sh` — scanner for persistent prop artifacts.
- `lib/package_list.sh` — extended with centralized package lists.

### Removed
- `post-fs-data.sh` — merged into `service.sh`.
- `webroot/js/clock.ts` — dead file.
- Orphaned i18n keys cleaned up from 4 translation files.

### WebUI
- Navigation restructured: replaced Actions/Advanced/Keybox/Tools with Home/Setup/Maintain/Settings — clearer per-tab purpose.
- Added Danger Zone section under Maintain tab — red error-colored header for destructive operations.
- Added confirmation dialog for all destructive actions — error-colored alert with Cancel/Continue.
- URL hash routing (`#home`, `#setup`, `#maintain`, `#settings`) with `popstate` listener for back/forward.
- Tab persistence — last visited tab saved to localStorage, restored on reload.
- Removed active-tab guard — re-tapping navigates to the tab (acts as refresh).
- Increased section title font sizes for better readability.
- Danger Zone description spacing tightened.
- RTL centering for nav-bar and toast.
- Synced missing i18n keys across all translations, cleaned up orphaned keys.
- Removed hardcoded module path fallback.

### Logging
- Most feature scripts follow `[TAG] Start` / `[TAG] Finish` pattern (16/18; `cleanup.sh` and `kill_play_store.sh` use alternative wording).
- `pif.sh`: rewritten to detect variant by script presence on disk, logs variant and per-script results.
- `pif2.sh`: logs spoof engine detection status.
- `zygisk_next.sh`: state-aware loop, reports N/3 settings applied.

### Other
- curl binary verification before use — falls back to wget if broken.

## v1.2.0

### Feature Toggle System
- Added Control page — new nav tab with per-feature enable/disable toggles.
- Boot Behavior section — toggle recovery folder hiding, boot hardening, bootloader spoofer block, ROM spoof engine block, and LSPosed ODEX cleanup individually.
- Action Pipeline section — toggle individual action-button steps: kill Play Store, regenerate target, set security patch, set verified boot hash, set fingerprint.
- Toggle values stored as config files via `cfg_get`/`cfg_set` — survive reboots and app uninstalls.
- Every feature script sources `config_env.sh` and gates itself against its toggle before running.

### Conflict Resolution System
- Data-driven conflict registry (`_conflict_registry`) in `common.sh` — single source of truth for module metadata, scripts, and feature claims.
- `_conflict_claimed()` iterates all registry entries dynamically — adding a new conflicting module requires one line in the registry. No hardcoded case blocks.
- `resolve_conflicts()` and `_conflict_claimed()` are now fully data-driven loops over the registry instead of per-module hardcoded blocks.
- `apply_conflict_toggles()` now correctly enables Specter features when no module claims priority, and disables them when any `priority_module` claims the feature.
- `conflict_set_choice()` — saves choice to module config, renames/restores the conflicting module's boot scripts, and recalculates all toggles.
- Config migration: old `/data/adb/Specter/config/conflict_*.val` files are automatically migrated to module config on first boot.
- Conflict backup system restored — `conflict_backups.txt` tracks renamed scripts so `uninstall.sh` can restore them.
- WebUI integration: `conflicts.sh` helper script exposes JSON status and set commands to the WebUI.
- Removed hardcoded module lists from TypeScript — all conflict data comes from shell registry via JSON.
- Toggle states refresh live after conflict change — no page reload needed.
- `apply_prop_hardening()` now consistently returns 0 — prevents `set -e` exits in cleanup.sh.

### WebUI Restructure
- Merged Setup and Maintain pages into single Tools page — 5 nav tabs reduced to 4 for better phone fit.
- Old `#setup` and `#maintain` URL hashes automatically migrate to `#tools` on first load.
- Last-visited tab persistence migrated accordingly.

### Navigation
- Double-tap nav tab: 1 tap switches page (no scroll reset), 2 taps on same tab scrolls to top.
- Nav bar right-padding clipping fixed — removed `max-width` constraint.

### Install Behavior
- Removed forced `target.sh` execution on module flash — no longer overwrites user's custom target.txt on reinstall.
- Conflict detection prompt during install — detects bootloader spoofer, HyperCeiler, LuckyTool packages and asks whether to block them at boot.

### Action Pipeline
- Replaced monolithic `orchestrator.sh` call in `action.sh` with individually gated feature calls — skipped features log nothing and don't abort the pipeline.
- `block_rom_spoof_engines` wrapped in background subshell for boot safety.

### Feature Script Improvements
- `gms.sh`: DroidGuard process kill by name pattern — kills droidguard processes even if their packages aren't listed.
- `target.sh`: TEESimulator detection refactored to use `_is_teesimulator` helper instead of fragile module.prop author parsing.
- `boot_hash.sh`: persists computed boot hash via `cfg_set stored_boot_hash`.
- `package_list.sh`: `GMS_KILL_LIST` deduplicated and reorganized — removed redundant entries, added safetycore.
- `disable_bootloader_spoofer` respects user's install-time conflict choice flag.

### Dialog Redesign (Material Design 3)
- `confirmDestructive`: Rewritten per M3 alert dialog spec — added `warning` icon in error-container circle, action name as headline, `md-filled-button` with error tokens for confirm action. Removed all inline styles.
- `openFileBrowser`: Complete rewrite — replaced 40+ inline style attributes with CSS classes, removed inline `onmouseenter`/`onmouseleave` event handlers (now CSS `:hover`), fixed button from `md-filled-tonal-button` to `md-filled-button`, added XSS-safe `escapeHtml()`.
- `privateChoice`: Both buttons changed to `md-text-button` (equal binary choice), removed `type="alert"`, removed all inline styles.
- `detectedDialog`: Added `type="alert"`, changed confirm button to `md-filled-button`, replaced all inline styles with CSS classes.
- `showErrorDialog`: Added `type="alert"` for proper alertdialog ARIA role, renamed generic class.
- `runDevAction`: Scoped generic class names to avoid conflicts.
- `danger_confirm` translation changed from `"Continue"` to `"Proceed"` across all 5 languages.

### README
- Updated screenshot grid to match new nav structure — replaced `setup.png`/`maintain.png` with `tools.png`/`control.png`.

### Documentation
- Added Legal disclaimer — educational purposes only, no liability for misuse.
- Added Warning section — outlines risks (warranty void, boot loops, app bans, etc.).
- Added Support section with Ko-fi, PayPal, BTC, and ETC donation options.
- Added `docs/CONFLICTS.md` — conflict handling policy with per-module resolution table.

### Other
- README simplified — replaced verbose background with quick start, streamlined features list, added screenshot grid.
- Removed CI badge from README.
